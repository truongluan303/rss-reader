# RSS Reader
This program will check for new content in RSS feeds and summarizes that
content to a user. It can manage multiple RSS feeds, check its current
feeds, and add or remove by command-line interaction.

### Running Instructions

To use the program, simply run
`python rss_reader.py`.

The program will act like a shell where the user can use `add`, `remove`
commands to add or remove a rss url.
`check` command will keep pulling all the new posts from the existing
rss urls to the console output.
To exit the loop, use either `ctrl+C` or `exit` command.
